# **Description**

Star Jeans is a fictional E-commerce company located in the US. Its owners decided to create the company to enter in the country's fashion market selling Jeans for male outfit. The first step is to maintain a low-cost operational system and scale as the customers rate grows up. 
Given the business situation, some important questions must be answered:

1. What is the best price to sell the products?
2. What types of Jeans and colors for the product model?
3. What is the raw material needed?

Star Jeans' main competitors are H&M and Macy's.

# **Dataset**

- The dataset for this project has been extracted from H&M's website's jeans catalog.
- BeautifulSoup was used to extract the showcase products and their respective info (color, size, price, etc.)
